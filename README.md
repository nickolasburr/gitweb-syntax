# Gitweb Syntax Highlighting

Older versions of Gitweb lack support for syntax highlighting, and often times it can be difficult to upgrade versions without significant downtime. This microlibrary provides customizable support for syntax highlighting by using <a href="https://highlightjs.org" target="_blank">highlight.js</a> and (optionally) jQuery. By default, support is provided for C, C++, Perl, PHP, Ruby, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, syntax highlighting will match synonymous and variant file types (.e.g .h files in C, C++).
